# Ensures all dependency updates target 'stg' branch first
# Flow: Dependabot PR → stg → main (via auto-pr-prd.yml workflow)
#
# Versioning Policy:
# - Stay at latest - 1 version unless latest-1 has EOL < 1 year
# - See .github/VERSIONING_POLICY.md for full policy details
# - Dependabot PRs must be reviewed against this policy before merging
#
# Review Checklist:
# 1. Does PR upgrade to latest - 1? → Approve
# 2. Does PR upgrade to latest? → Check EOL status
#    - If latest-1 has EOL < 1 year → Approve
#    - If latest-1 has no EOL or EOL > 1 year → Reject (comment with policy)
# 3. Does PR include critical security fixes? → Approve (even if latest)
