# Traefik Static Configuration for Google Cloud Run
# This configuration uses environment variables to discover backend services

# Entry points
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":8080"  # Cloud Run uses port 8080 (only port exposed)
    # No HTTP to HTTPS redirect as Cloud Run handles HTTPS termination
    # Note: forwarded-headers middleware is applied per-router, not at entrypoint level

# Providers - File-based for Cloud Run (no Docker socket available)
providers:
  file:
    directory: /etc/traefik/dynamic
    watch: true

# API and Dashboard
# Serve API and dashboard on the same port (8080) as web traffic
# When insecure: false, we need to create explicit routes in dynamic/routes.yml
# to expose the API and dashboard via the api@internal service
# Note: When insecure: false, do NOT set api.entryPoint in static config.
# The entryPoints are specified in the dynamic routes to api@internal instead.
