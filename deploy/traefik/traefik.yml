# Providers - how Traefik discovers services
providers:
  # Docker provider for local development
  docker:
    exposedByDefault: false  # Only expose services with traefik.enable=true label
    network: e-skimming-labs-network    # Use the labs network for service discovery (Docker Compose adds project prefix)
    watch: true              # Watch for container changes
    # Note: Traefik filters unhealthy/starting containers by default
