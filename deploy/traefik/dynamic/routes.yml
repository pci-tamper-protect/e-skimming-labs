# Traefik Dynamic Configuration - Middlewares and Static Routes
# This file defines middlewares and static routes (like Traefik API) for use by both Docker and File providers
#
# For local development (Docker Compose):
#   - Routers and services are defined via Docker labels in docker-compose.yml
#   - Middlewares are defined here and referenced with @file suffix
#
# For Cloud Run (File provider only):
#   - Routers, services, and middlewares are generated by plugin or entrypoint.sh
#   - This file provides the middleware definitions and static API routes

http:
  # Static routers - always available regardless of plugin status
  routers:
    # Traefik API and Dashboard routers (high priority to match before application routes)
    # These routes expose Traefik's internal API and dashboard on port 8080
    # Based on: https://community.traefik.io/t/serving-traefiks-internal-dashboard-behind-traefik-itself/3457/7
    # When insecure: false, we must create explicit routes to api@internal
    # API: /api/http/*, /api/rawdata/*, /api/overview, etc.
    # Dashboard: /dashboard/
    traefik-api:
      rule: "PathPrefix(`/api/http`) || PathPrefix(`/api/rawdata`) || PathPrefix(`/api/overview`) || Path(`/api/version`)"
      service: api@internal
      priority: 1000  # High priority to match before application /api/* routes (seo=500, analytics=500)
      entryPoints:
        - web
    traefik-dashboard:
      rule: "PathPrefix(`/dashboard`)"
