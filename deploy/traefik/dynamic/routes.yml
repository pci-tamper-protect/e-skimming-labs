# Traefik Dynamic Configuration - Middlewares Only
# This file defines middlewares for use by both Docker and File providers
#
# For local development (Docker Compose):
#   - Routers and services are defined via Docker labels in docker-compose.yml
#   - Middlewares are defined here and referenced with @file suffix
#
# For Cloud Run (File provider only):
#   - Routers, services, and middlewares are generated by entrypoint.sh
#   - This file provides the middleware definitions
