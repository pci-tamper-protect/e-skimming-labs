# Local Development Auth Stubs
# These empty chain middlewares disable auth for local Docker Compose development.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file is intentionally NOT copied to Cloud Run deployments.
# In Cloud Run, the real auth middlewares (ForwardAuth to Firebase) are generated
# by the traefik-cloudrun-provider or defined in a separate production config.
#
# This separation prevents the empty stubs from overriding real auth in production.
